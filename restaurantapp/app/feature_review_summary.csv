charlie brett's at the allerton,Yorkshire,price,This was served with oven chips and very watery vegetables.The dessert of bakewell tart was OK although it was clear that some kind of cheap packet mix custard had been used.Now we only pay £16 for this and that is not much these days ( many of us would pay a bit more for something edible ) but even at that price I must ask if none of the cooks have any pride in their work ? How awful it must be to go into a working environment in which you simply do not give a damn.The crazy thing is that we are anywhere between 30 and 50 middle aged mostly quite affluent men,-1
